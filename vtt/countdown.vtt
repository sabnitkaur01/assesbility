00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.960
Next.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.280
My phone just quit working.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.120
I can't imagine why you always put it down
with such grace,

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.600
but we use it for primarily,
mostly just texting and Facebook.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.200
We have more computing power in your

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.480
pocket than NASA did when
they put a man on the moon.

7
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.360
We use it for mostly texting and Facebook.

8
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.840
This is why humanity is doomed.

9
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.880
OK, you know, I don't need
your smug tech guy attitude.

10
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.520
Where's your manager?
And I go get them.

11
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.960
Yeah,

12
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.080
hello.
I'm the manager so I can help you with MS.

13
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
.

14
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.240
You just lost yourself
a customer, smart ass.

15
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.720
I did.

16
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.200
Do you think I'll be able
to find another one or next?

17
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.360
I need a new phone.

18
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.840
OK, what kind of specs
are you looking for?

19
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.960
These are actually just came in.
Yeah, sure.

20
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.840
That would be OK

21
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.080
if you could just wait.

22
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.720
I run the car.

23
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.760
All right.
Never mind.

24
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.880
I trust you.

25
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.920
Something in your eyes says you're
a normal, completely sane person.

26
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.400
Need me to transfer a SIM card?

27
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.480
No, I want all new everything.

28
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.360
New phone, new no new service.

29
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.600
OK, off the books for one hundred cash.
I can jailbreak it.

30
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
You can have every app you'll ever need.
No, I just.

31
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.200
I want it however it comes ok.

32
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.040
Joe.

33
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.960
Good,

34
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.760
anything else I can help you with?

35
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.360
No.

36
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.680
OK, next.

37
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.280
What the hell is this,
what this app, why is it on their.

38
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.200
It's weird you buy it.

39
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.840
We could have done that,
you literally just turned it on.

40
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.360
OK, deep breath.

41
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.280
Um, you just delete it,

42
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.520
it won't let you delete it.

43
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.280
Just give it to me.

44
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.080
All right, we're on your wireless.
Please leave a review.

45
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.400
Appreciate it.
And what app was she talking about?
