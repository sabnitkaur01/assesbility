00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.840
As an arbiter of the law,
withhold knowledge of historical

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.000
jurisprudence in this country, race
must always be considered a variable.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.680
You have precious time misleading.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.200
I suggest that you don't waste it
by making arguments you've already made.

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.520
These are not my words,
Justice Strickland.

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.360
They use.

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.440
You wrote them in your
1985 ruling in Bryant v.

8
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.200
Topeka, an equal protection case dealing
with a state housing lottery program.

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.440
Racism is built into the DNA of America.

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.240
And as long as we turn a blind eye
to the pain of those suffering under its

11
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.400
oppression, we will never
escape those origins.

12
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.480
The only safeguard people of color have is

13
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.760
the right to a defense,
and we won't even give them that,

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.600
which means that the promise of civil
rights has never been fulfilled.

15
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.920
Due to the failure of our justice system,

16
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.800
our public defense system in particular,
Jim Crow is alive and kicking.

17
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.160
Laws that made it illegal for blacks

18
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.680
and whites to be buried in the same
cemetery,

19
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.560
they categorize people into quadroons
and octoroon as they punish a black person

20
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.880
for seeking medical attention
in a white hospital.

21
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.840
Some may claim that slavery has ended,
but tell that to the inmates who are kept

22
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.920
in cages and told that they
don't have any rights at all.

23
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.400
People like my client, Nathaniel Leahy,
and millions of people like him who are

24
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.440
relegated to a subclass of human
existence in our prisons.

25
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.400
There was no alternative to justice
in this case, there was no other option.

26
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.880
To decide against my plaintiff
is to choose of lining the pockets

27
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.200
of prison owners over providing basic
defense for the people who live in them.

28
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.800
And is that the America that this
court really wants to live in

29
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.800
and money is more important than humanity

30
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.720
or criminality is confused
with mental health?

31
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.680
The Sixth Amendment was ratified in 1791.

32
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.000
It's been two hundred and twenty
six years since then.

33
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.000
Let's finally guarantee its
rights to all of our citizens.
